            <p>Hey there and welcome to my portfolio page. Im glad you took the time to stop by and visit. <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> My name is Jonathan Emery and I am currently employed at UST Logisical Systems in the heart of dowmtown Greenville, SC. I am learning to become a web devolper. I have taken a few online courses and this was a project for one of the courses. I am super excited to be working on web pages. The thrill of breaking something in the code and trying to fix it can be complicated, but when I figure it out it is very exciting. Enough about all of that and a little bit more about me. I recenty got married at Folly Beach, Charleston, SC. I met my wonderful wife when I was just getting into my teenage years and after a few years of not talking we began to rekindle and become even closer than before. She is so wonderful and I wouldnt trade her for anything in the world. We had our first baby boy this year as well. He was born premature and has been in the NICU since birth. He is beginning to get better and better and hopefully will be home very soon! Other than spending time with my family I enjoy: playng video games with my friends, and watching baseball, and youtube videos. I would have to say my favorite team is the Chicago Cubs. They recently won the world series and it was a very emotional experience for me. That might sound crazy to you but to me baseball is life. It was in 2015 when Jake Areietta threw a no hitter that I reconnected with my wife. I usually never post on facebook and that night was special. When he finshed the no hitter i shared a post that the cubs posted on their facebook page and she saw it and decided to message me. In 2016 we watched as the cubs stuggled in the postseason getting taken out by the Mets. Then in 2017 seeing them win it all with her was special to me. I hope to get better and better at coding and hope to not stop at HTML and CSS and learn as many langauges as I can. I will be posting all of my creations online either on github or codepen. Feel free to click the button at the top and view some of my creations. Thank you! <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
